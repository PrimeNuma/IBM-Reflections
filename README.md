# IBM-Reflections
IBM Reflection Macro's

All of these macro's use the CDZA_IMPA form which will need to be installed by importing the .FRM and FRX files into IBM Reflections.

The code is a mixture of the native reflections code and Visual Basic. As it's quite an old program there are some things which will not 
work so there are some strange examples where I have had to find a work around (Using END instead of END SUB for example). 

I'm in the process of creating a new form that can handle multiple menu's so functions can be categorised by department but I need to
adjust the code.
